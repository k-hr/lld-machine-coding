## Design a ParkingLot
Design a parking lot which can hold up to X cars one point of time.
Each slot in the parking lot has a number starting from 1.
Whenever a car enters the parking lot, the slot is assigned and car details are captured including the color and registration number of the car.
The same slot can not be given to more than one car at one point of time. We should deny the parking in case all slots are filled.
From the system we should be able to query.
- Slot number in which a car with a given registration number is parked.
- List of all the parked slots.
- Registration numbers of all cars of a particular colour
